The code in this directory is copied from the `tailwindcss` repo at https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/tree/4f9f603e12b51cc53b8a09c7739b8f88c8eb87eb.
This repo uses the old Tailwind 'defaultExtractor'-related code, to avoid having
to use the platform-specific binaries that Tailwind v4 uses, because it may not work on different dev machines.

TODO get rid of this code, replace it the newer Tailwind extractor code because it's faster.
